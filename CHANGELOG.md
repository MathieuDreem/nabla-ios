### Added

- Reporting: Add an ErrorReporter to report anonymous events to nabla servers to help debug some features like video calls.

### Changed

- Removed the `showComposer` parameter from `createConversationViewController` method and relied on `Conversation` `isLocked` property to hide the composer.  
⚠️ If you were using the `showComposer` parameter of `NablaClient.shared.messaging.views.createConversationViewController`, it is not available anymore and you should migrate to using lock conversation from the Console.

### Added
- Support for dynamic consents in Scheduling module that you can customize from the console.

### Changed
- The `NablaClient.initialize` method now takes a `Configuration` struct instead of multiple params.
⚠️ This change is breaking and you will need to update all `NablaClient` `initialize` and `init` calls.

- `NablaTheme` colors have been reworked to better support dark mode. The new colors can be found in `NablaTheme.Colors`.
- `NablaTheme` fonts have been reworked for better consistency. The new fonts can be found in `NablaTheme.Fonts`.
